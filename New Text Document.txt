log out does not work on pages where authentification is required, my initial thoughts are that the redirect is not working properly because that is something that I had to change so look into redirect with the new version of react router.

proceed to checkout properly redirects the page if the user is not logged in so that could be something to look at to compair.

style the new customer? register section
